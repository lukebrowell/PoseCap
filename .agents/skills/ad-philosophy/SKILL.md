description: Universal agent behavior and documentation discipline — think before coding, ground in real patterns, prefer simplicity, make surgical changes, define verifiable goals, verify before claiming done, and write documentation that captures only definitions and decisions. Auto-invokes on non-trivial changes, refactors, debugging, "think before coding", "ground before coding", "verify done", "before implementing", on documentation work — "writing docs", "writing readme", "writing architecture", "writing adr", "writing task", "audit docs" — or whenever the task is ambiguous enough that guardrails matter.
summary: Universal agent guardrails (think before coding, verify before claiming done). Auto-loads on non-trivial work.

<background_information>
Six behaviors apply to every non-trivial change. Bias toward caution over speed; for trivial diffs, use judgment. A separate Documentation Discipline block applies to every document the agent writes.

<instructions>
**Think Before Coding.** Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs. State assumptions explicitly; ask when uncertain. If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently. If a simpler approach exists, say so. If something is unclear, stop, name the confusion, ask.

**Ground Before Coding.** Anchor in real patterns before writing code. For non-trivial changes, invoke `/ad-ground` — the workflow-operational skill that runs the four-source research pass (official docs, validated implementation references, in-repo patterns, git history) and synthesizes a happy path with citations. The skill carries the prescriptive deviation gate; this section carries posture only. Skip for diffs describable in one sentence.

**Simplicity First.** Minimum code that solves the problem. No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code. No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested. No error handling for impossible scenarios. Comments justify why, not what. No commented-out code; no orphan `TODO`/`FIXME` without an issue/ADR/follow-up reference. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite.

**Surgical Changes.** Touch only what you must. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Don't refactor things that aren't broken. Match existing style. If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it. Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused. Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked. Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

**Goal-Driven Execution.** Define success criteria. Loop until verified. Transform vague tasks into verifiable goals ("Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"). Before modifying a file, list which tests cover it; run, modify, run; if none, write one first. For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verify step per item.

**Verify Before Claiming Done.** Type-check and tests verify code, not feature. For UI/runtime changes, exercise in a browser. Can't verify? Say so — don't claim success. Never bypass gates (`--no-verify`, skipped hooks, deleted failing tests).

**Documentation Discipline.** Every document the agent writes obeys eleven rules.

1. **Definitions and decisions only.** What is true now, plus the decisions that brought it there. No speculation, no history, no unfounded plans. A deferred decision is in scope when *recorded* — an accepted ADR or a task file is the basis; "we might do X later" without a record is cut.
2. **No dates, version stamps, `DRAFT` markers, or changelogs in narrative documents.** Applies to `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and prose pages outside lifecycle-managed artifact directories. **Lifecycle-managed artifacts are exempt** — PRDs under `doc/product/`, specs under `doc/specs/`, ADRs under `doc/adr/`, and tasks under `doc/tasks/` keep their lifecycle fields because those fields are the auditability primitive. Outside those artifacts, use git history.
3. **No emoji anywhere.** Not in docs, code, source comments, commit messages, PR bodies, or skill outputs. Severity and status use words; structural cues use Markdown.
4. **Business context first.** Open with *why* — the problem, the constraint, the user — before *what* and *how*. First paragraph answers "what would break if this document didn't exist".
5. **One scope per document. No duplication.** Link instead of copying. The canonical location owns the content; everywhere else references it.
6. **Code is the primary documentation of behavior.** Comments justify *why* a non-obvious choice was made — never restate *what*. If the comment explains *what*, rename or refactor.
7. **No commented-out code; no orphan `TODO` / `FIXME` in source.** Every deferred item references a tracked work item — a GitHub Issue, or a per-task file under `doc/tasks/NNNN-*.md`. The trace must be addressable from the source line.
8. **Tests are living documentation of behavior.** Test names and assertions read as the spec they enforce. Spec changes drive test changes; never the reverse.
9. **Single responsibility per document.** Each document plays one role — *definition* (pillar docs; read-mostly; no per-item tracking UI), *decision-record* (ADRs, specs; single `Status:` field; mostly immutable after acceptance), or *tracking* (tasks; full checkbox / append-only-Notes UI). A definition doc with checkboxes or a decision-record with granular per-item tracking has taken on adjacent layers' responsibilities.
10. **Each layer owns its directory index.** `doc/adr/`, `doc/tasks/`, `doc/specs/`, `doc/product/` are canonical indices of their layers. Other documents do not list or digest these indices — filesystem listing is the index.
11. **Cross-references must be load-bearing.** Test: if removing the reference leaves the surrounding statement intact, the reference was decoration — drop it. Literature citations are load-bearing by definition.

Walk this list before declaring any documentation task done.

<output_contract>
This skill emits no file. Its job is to set the agent's working posture for the next non-trivial change.
</output_contract>

## Next

- Continue current work with the six behaviors active. This skill is posture, not a one-shot task.
- `/ad-ground` for non-trivial research before code.
- `/ad-next` when uncertain where to go in the workflow.
- `/ad-review` before merging non-trivial diffs.
