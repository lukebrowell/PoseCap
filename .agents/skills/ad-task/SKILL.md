name: ad-task
description: Draft a new task tracking file at doc/tasks/NNNN-<short-slug>.md, using a checkbox-toggle + append-only-Notes format optimized for LLM editing. Use when the user wants to create, draft, scaffold, or open a task, ticket, work item, or backlog entry tracked in the repo. Status starts at proposed.
summary: Draft a new task at `doc/tasks/NNNN-<slug>.md`.
---

<background_information>
Drafts `doc/tasks/<NNNN>-<short-slug>.md` for one tracked task. Format chosen so status changes via single checkbox toggles and Notes is append-only — cheap, reviewable, idempotent edits.
</background_information>

<instructions>
Step 1 — determine NNNN and slug. List `doc/tasks/`. NNNN = next available 4-digit number after the highest existing (mirrors the ADR convention). If `doc/tasks/` does not exist, create it; start at 0001. Slug: kebab-case, ≤6 words, derived from the user's task title.

Step 2 — interview to fill. Ask one question per missing field, in this order:
- Context: why this task exists, what problem it solves, any assumption being tested.
- Acceptance Criteria: measurable conditions. Each is a checkbox; pass/fail must be observable, not aspirational ("loads in under 2s", not "fast enough").
- Plan: concrete sequential steps with file paths where applicable. Each is a checkbox.
- Owner: ask.
- Execution: `AFK` when the task is specified enough for an agent to execute with bounded context and disjoint write scope; `HITL` when it needs human judgment, taste, external access, or frequent back-and-forth.
- Spec ref: ask; leave blank when no spec drives this task. When a feature spec exists at `doc/specs/NNNN-<slug>.md`, link it here so the spec's Related → Tasks list reciprocates.
- Board ref: ask; leave blank if solo work.

Status starts at proposed. Created: today, ISO format. Notes: empty. Definition of Done section: copy verbatim from the template.

Do NOT invent values. When the user does not know something, leave `<TODO>` and ask. Stop after writing the file — do not start work.

Step 3 — write the file. Path: `doc/tasks/<NNNN>-<short-slug>.md`. Use the template below.

Step 4 — editing guidance for later turns. When the user later works on the task, edit the file by:
- toggling checkboxes (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`),
- appending to Notes (date each entry, `### YYYY-MM-DD`),
- never rewriting existing sections.

Status flips to done only when every Acceptance Criterion and every Definition of Done item is checked.

<template path="doc/tasks/NNNN-<slug>.md">
# Task `<NNNN>`: `<short imperative title>`

**Status:** `<proposed | in-progress | blocked | done>`
**Created:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>`
**Owner:** `<name or role>`
**Execution:** `<AFK | HITL>`
**Spec ref:** `<doc/specs/NNNN-<slug>.md or SPEC-NNNN — blank when no spec drives this task>`
**Board ref:** `<external ticket URL or ID — blank for solo work>`

## Context

`<Why this task exists. What problem it solves. Any assumption being tested.>`

## Acceptance Criteria

Verifiable conditions. Each as a checkbox so progress is point-editable.

- [ ] `<criterion 1>`
- [ ] `<criterion 2>`
- [ ] `<criterion 3>`

## Plan

Concrete sequential steps. Each as a checkbox. Reference file paths where applicable.

- [ ] `<step 1: action with file path if applicable>`
- [ ] `<step 2>`
- [ ] `<step 3>`

## Notes

Append-only log. Date each entry. Never rewrite past entries.

### `<YYYY-MM-DD>`

`<observation, decision, blocker, learning>`

## Definition of Done

All Acceptance Criteria checked, plus:

- [ ] Local tests pass (or N/A documented in Notes)
- [ ] Code review completed (human or fresh-context reviewer per WORKFLOW §10)
- [ ] No orphan `TODO`/`FIXME` introduced
- [ ] Status updated to `done` and Notes log closes the task
</template>

<output_contract>
A single new file at `doc/tasks/<NNNN>-<short-slug>.md`. Status proposed. Notes empty. No existing tasks modified. No invented values.

Task files are decision-record artifacts and are exempt from the no-dates rule (Documentation Discipline §2): `**Created:**` and the dated `Notes` log are required by design. Remaining Documentation Discipline rules (`WORKFLOW.md` §2) apply at write time:
- No emoji anywhere in the file.
- `Context` is the business-context-first section — *why this task exists* before *Acceptance Criteria*.
- One scope: one task per file.
- No speculation. Acceptance criteria must be measurable; do not list aspirational items.
- `Notes` is append-only and dated per entry — that is the auditability primitive, not a violation of Rule 2.
</output_contract>

## Next

- Implement. Toggle Acceptance Criteria checkboxes and append to `Notes` as work lands.
- `/ad-review main..HEAD` (or current scope) before merge — the task DoD requires a fresh-context §10 review.
- Flip Status to `done` once every Acceptance Criterion and Definition-of-Done item is checked.
- If the task implements a spec, the spec's `Related → Tasks` list should reciprocate the link.
