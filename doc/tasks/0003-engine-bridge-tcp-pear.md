# Task 0003: Engine bridge — TCP pose server wrapping PEAR

**Status:** in progress
**Created:** 2026-06-11
**Owner:** alexandremendoncaalvaro
**Execution:** HITL
**Spec ref:** doc/specs/0001-live-webcam-pose-streaming.md
**Board ref:**

## Context

The engine side reuses the POC's verified inference loop (`PEAR/live_webcam.py:146-209`: capture without CAP_DSHOW — it froze some Windows webcams; YOLO classes=0 imgsz=640 most-confident box; crop-ratio patch; torch.no_grad; cv2.Rodrigues conversion) and replaces the pickle/os.replace file handoff with NDJSON over a localhost TCP server (ADR-0002/0003). PEAR installs from a pinned external revision (ADR-0005); weights pin a HuggingFace revision with `weights_only=True` — the POC's global `torch.load` monkeypatch (`live_webcam.py:13`) is banned. Device enumeration moves here because the engine owns the environment that can enumerate (the POC's in-Blender attempt never worked). The spec's open question on TCP port strategy gets resolved and recorded in this task's Notes. HITL: needs CUDA GPU and a physical webcam. Depends on tasks 0001-0002.

## Acceptance Criteria

Verifiable conditions. Each as a checkbox so progress is point-editable.

- [x] `uv run posecap-engine devices` prints a JSON device list usable by the addon dropdown.
- [ ] Live mode serves schema-valid NDJSON pose frames at inference rate; "no person" produces explicit status frames, not silence.
- [x] Integration test against recorded fixture frames (no live camera) validates frames against the golden schema; `gpu` tag skips cleanly without CUDA.
- [x] Engine exits within 5 seconds of parent-PID death and on stream-socket disconnect (decision between the two recorded in Notes).
- [x] PEAR revision and HF weight revision pinned in config; no `weights_only=False` anywhere (grep-clean).
- [x] Inference FPS logged at INFO on an interval to a rotating log; no per-frame disk I/O or above-DEBUG logging on the hot path.
- [x] TCP port strategy implemented and documented (Notes + contracts handshake if schema changed).

## Plan

Concrete sequential steps. Each as a checkbox. Reference file paths where applicable.

- [x] `engine/src/posecap_engine/capture.py` — webcam open/read (no CAP_DSHOW), device enumeration.
- [x] `engine/src/posecap_engine/pear_adapter.py` — model load (pinned), detect+infer+Rodrigues, reusing POC loop structure.
- [x] `engine/src/posecap_engine/stream_server.py` — TCP server, NDJSON frames via contracts codec, single-client lifecycle.
- [x] `engine/src/posecap_engine/watchdog.py` — parent-PID + disconnect liveness (platform adapter).
- [x] `engine/src/posecap_engine/cli.py` — `devices` and `live` entry points.
- [x] Resolve port strategy; record in Notes; update contracts if handshake needed.
- [x] `tests/engine/` — fixture-frame integration tests (`integration`/`gpu` tags).
- [ ] Full gate + /ad-commit.

## Notes

Append-only log. Date each entry. Never rewrite past entries.

Decision: the recorded-frame fixtures created for this task's integration tests carry ground-truth pose labels (rendered SMPL-X sequences with known parameters) so the pose-accuracy eval harness (PRD Next roadmap) has labeled data from day one. The harness itself is out of this task's scope — it gets its own spike after the engine CLI lands.

### 2026-06-27

Started the non-GPU engine slice: `posecap-engine devices`, `posecap-engine live --fixture`, single-client localhost TCP NDJSON streaming via the contracts codec, parent-process watchdog, socket-disconnect shutdown, rotating-log setup, and pinned PEAR / HF model revisions. PEAR inference itself remains unchecked until the external checkout, model weights, CUDA, and physical webcam are available.

Port strategy decision: `live` defaults to TCP port `0`, letting the OS allocate a free localhost port. The engine prints one startup JSON line to stdout with `{"event":"listening","host":"127.0.0.1","port":<actual>}`; the addon will read that line from the spawned process before connecting. No wire-contract handshake changed: pose frames on the socket remain newline-delimited JSON `PoseFrame` lines.

Liveness decision: both parent-PID death and client disconnect are implemented. The accept loop polls the parent watchdog; the stream loop checks parent liveness before each frame and exits when the client sends FIN/RST.

Local verification added for the engine checkpoint: `devices` emits a JSON object even when OpenCV is absent, fixture streaming decodes through `posecap_contracts`, empty fixtures fail explicitly instead of spinning, the FPS logger emits only after its interval, and the `gpu` smoke skips cleanly without `torch` or CUDA. The PEAR adapter now validates the external checkout boundary before reporting that CUDA/HITL inference remains incomplete.

OpenCV is now an engine dependency so `uv run posecap-engine devices` can enumerate from a normal `uv sync`; on this workstation `--max-index 0` returned Camera 0 at 1280x720 and 60 FPS. The command still emits a JSON object with an empty list plus `error` if the capture backend is unavailable.

Completed the PEAR adapter code path short of hardware-in-the-loop validation: `posecap-engine live --pear-root` now validates the external checkout shape, imports PEAR lazily from that root, requires CUDA, downloads `BestWJH/PEAR_models/ehm_model_stage1.pt` at the pinned HuggingFace revision, loads it with `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`, instantiates `Ehm_Pipeline`, runs YOLO person detection at `imgsz=640`, crops PEAR's 256x256 patch, runs inference under `torch.no_grad`, converts PEAR rotation matrices to Rodrigues vectors with `cv2.Rodrigues`, and emits contract `PoseFrame` frames. Detection or crop misses now yield explicit `no_person` frames. CLI live options also expose camera width, height, YOLO threshold, and crop ratio with the POC live defaults.

Local verification for the PEAR adapter remains fake-based until CUDA, a physical webcam, model weights, and the external PEAR checkout are available together. The current uv environment has OpenCV but does not have `torch`, `torchvision`, `ultralytics`, `huggingface_hub`, or `lightning`, so live PEAR HITL was not attempted. Current gates are green: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run pyright`, `uv run lint-imports`, and `uv run pytest -q` (`77 passed, 1 deselected`). The explicit GPU smoke `uv run pytest tests/engine/test_gpu_environment.py -q -m gpu` skipped cleanly without CUDA. Source/test paths are grep-clean for `weights_only=False`; documentation still mentions the banned form only as policy.

Prepared a PEAR runtime doctor without turning task 0003 into the full installer task: `posecap-engine doctor` emits JSON readiness checks for Python version, NVIDIA driver visibility, required PEAR/PyTorch imports, `torch.cuda`, external PEAR checkout shape and git revision, licensed SMPL/SMPL-X/FLAME asset paths, and optional pinned HuggingFace weight download via `--download-weights`. The command returns a non-zero exit code when any required check is `error`, so the future addon/installer can gate on it without parsing human prose.

Created the external PEAR checkout at `C:\Dev\PoseCap-PEAR` and checked it out to `977331937ea8c3d08ae0254d8831d640d46a5cf6`, outside this repository. The real doctor run on this workstation reports: NVIDIA driver/GPU visible (`RTX 3080`), OpenCV and `rich` importable, Python 3.12 warning for PEAR HITL validation, missing `torch`, `torchvision`, `ultralytics`, `huggingface_hub`, `lightning`, `timm`, `omegaconf`, `roma`, `einops`, `colored`, and `pytorch3d`, missing external YOLO detector at `model_zoo/yolov8x.pt`, missing licensed SMPL/SMPL-X/FLAME asset paths, and pinned HF weights unchecked because `huggingface_hub` is absent. Current full gates after adding the doctor are green: `uv run ruff check .`, `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run pyright`, `uv run lint-imports`, and `uv run pytest -q` (`81 passed, 1 deselected`).

Follow-up runtime preparation on the same workstation resolved the installable PEAR dependencies short of PyTorch3D: `torch`/`torchvision` CUDA wheels were installed with the uv PyTorch backend, `torch.cuda.is_available()` is true, and PyTorch reports the local `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080`. The PEAR pure-Python dependencies (`ultralytics`, `huggingface_hub`, `lightning`, `timm`, `omegaconf`, `roma`, `einops`, `colored`) now import under `posecap-engine doctor`. The adapter also no longer treats `model_zoo/yolov8x.pt` as required in the external PEAR checkout; if the local file is absent it passes `yolov8x.pt` to Ultralytics so the detector can resolve from its normal cache/download path.

Remaining PEAR HITL blockers are now narrow and explicit. `pytorch3d` has no wheel for the current Python 3.12 environment, and a source build against VS 2022 plus CUDA 12.8 reached native compilation but failed inside the PyTorch3D build (`mesh_normal_consistency_cpu.cpp`: `fatal error C1083: Cannot open compiler generated file: '': Invalid argument`). That is an installer/runtime compatibility decision, not a PEAR adapter code path issue; the setup path needs either a known-good Python/Torch/PyTorch3D matrix or a deliberate replacement/shim task before live inference can run. The licensed SMPL/SMPL-X/FLAME assets are still missing from `C:\Dev\PoseCap-PEAR\assets`; they must be downloaded by a license holder from official sources and must never be copied from the POC or committed to this repo.

The pinned PEAR Hugging Face checkpoint was verified with `uv run posecap-engine doctor --pear-root C:\Dev\PoseCap-PEAR --download-weights`; `ehm_model_stage1.pt` is available in the local Hugging Face cache at revision `bbac79d4d834a40d74393466e11f998b67b437e1`.

Created `doc/tasks/0007-pear-runtime-windows-matrix.md` as the focused runtime/installer gate for the remaining PyTorch3D blocker. Task 0003 should not continue environment mutation on the current Python 3.12 plus Torch 2.11 setup; live PEAR HITL validation stays blocked until task 0007 proves a Python 3.11 uv-managed Torch/Torchvision/PyTorch3D matrix and the licensed assets are installed from official sources.
