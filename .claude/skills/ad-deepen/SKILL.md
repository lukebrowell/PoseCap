# /ad-deepen

Implements [ADR-0020](../../doc/adr/0020-deep-modules-vocabulary.md) — the operational counterpart to the WORKFLOW §8 architectural vocabulary. Surfaces deepening opportunities and walks the user through them. Process scaffold; no primary file output.

Profile scope: **`team` and `mature` only.** Architectural deepening is premature for ≤200-line experiments. `poc` and `solo` users do not have this skill installed; to enable deepening, re-init the project at `team` profile (`agentic profile set team`) once the codebase has stabilized enough to warrant it. Per ADR-0020 §4.

## Step 0 — Confirm regime

Deepen is for the *stable-codebase, friction-visible* regime. Run when at least one holds:

- A module's interface is roughly as complex as its implementation (shallow module candidate).
- A concept is bouncing between modules across recent changes (locality candidate).
- A test cannot exercise the real bug pattern at the call site (interface-is-test-surface candidate).
- An adapter has been introduced for a hypothetical second implementation (two-adapters-rule violation).
- The user explicitly asks "where should this be refactored?" against a stable surface.

Route elsewhere when:

- The change is a one-line fix or mechanical refactor → no scaffold needed.
- The codebase is `poc`-shaped (one-shot script, ≤200 lines, no callers): deepening is premature; ship the experiment first.
- The friction is a *bug*, not a *shape* — `/ad-diagnose` (WORKFLOW §15).
- The friction is a *naming/vocabulary* drift — `/ad-domain`.
- The friction is *missing context*, not module shape — `/ad-grill`.

## Step 1 — Explore organically

Before naming candidates, read.

1. `Read CONTEXT.md` if it exists. Anchor domain vocabulary; the deepening proposals must use *Customer*, *Order*, *Triage role* — not *Service*, *Handler*, *Manager*.
2. `Read ARCHITECTURE.md` if it exists. Read accepted ADRs in `doc/adr/` covering the surface you are about to walk.
3. Walk the codebase noting *friction*:
   - Concepts bouncing between modules (locality fault).
   - Interfaces as wide as their implementations (shallow modules — apply the deletion test).
   - Tests that mock four things to exercise one path (test-surface fault).
   - Adapters with one concrete implementation (two-adapters-rule violation, if no second is planned).

Read with eyes for *shape*, not bugs. The friction is in module geometry; the bug-finding skill is `/ad-diagnose`.

## Step 2 — Present candidates numbered

For each deepening opportunity, produce a short numbered entry:

```markdown
### Candidate N: <one-line title using domain + architectural vocabulary>

**Files involved:** [`src/foo.ts:42`](../src/foo.ts:42), [`src/bar.ts`](../src/bar.ts).

**Friction:** <one-paragraph plain English — what hurts today, who feels it, when>.

**Proposal:** <one-paragraph plain English — what changes about the module shape>.

**Vocabulary check:** <Module / Interface / Seam / Adapter / Depth / Leverage / Locality applied here, per WORKFLOW §8>.

**Deletion test:** <if you imagine deleting the module today, what happens? If complexity vanishes → delete instead of refactoring. If complexity reappears across N callers → it earns its keep, deepen it>.

**Two-adapters check:** <if introducing a seam: name the second concrete adapter that justifies it. If only one adapter exists or is planned, the seam is hypothetical — drop it from the proposal>.

**Test surface impact:** <does the new shape make the right pattern testable at the call site? If not, the proposal is wrong-shaped>.

**ADR conflicts:** <name any accepted ADR this proposal contradicts. Flag for reopening only if the friction warrants it; otherwise the candidate is rejected>.
```

Number candidates 1, 2, 3, ... Order by leverage × locality (largest impact first, lowest blast radius among ties). Cap at five — past five, the user has too many to weigh.

## Step 3 — Grilling loop on the chosen candidate

The user picks one candidate by number. Drop into a grilling loop on that one:

1. Walk the design tree of the proposal branch by branch (one question per turn, recommendation included). Reuse the [`ad-grill`](../ad-grill/SKILL.md) discipline — codebase-first, single question, captured inline.
2. Add new domain terms to `CONTEXT.md` lazily via `/ad-domain` as the proposal surfaces them.
3. Offer an ADR only when the three criteria pass (hard to reverse, surprising without context, real trade-off —' ' If a deepening proposal does not need an ADR, it does not get one — most refactors do not.
4. When the proposal stabilizes: route to `/ad-tdg` (WORKFLOW §9) for the implementation pass with ground-truth pair + TDM + criterion-based selection.

Reject candidates the grilling loop reveals as wrong-shaped. Better to discard a candidate at this stage than to ship a deepening that doesn't deepen.

## Vocabulary discipline (always on)

Per [ADR-0020](../../doc/adr/0020-deep-modules-vocabulary.md), use the canonical vocabulary verbatim throughout the skill's output:

- **Module** — any unit with an interface and an implementation.
- **Interface** — what callers see.
- **Implementation** — what they don't.
- **Depth** — behavior leverage at the interface. Deep modules hide a lot of behavior behind a small interface.
- **Seam** — where behavior can be altered without editing in place (Feathers).
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam. *Role*, not *substance*.
- **Leverage** — what callers gain from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers gain from depth (concentrated change, bugs, knowledge).

Never use:

- "Boundary" (overloaded with DDD bounded contexts) — use *Seam* or *Interface*.
- "Service" / "Handler" / "Manager" / "Helper" without a domain noun in front — these are noise.
- "Depth = implementation lines / interface lines" — explicitly rejected by ADR-0020. Rewards padding.

When the candidate's friction touches a domain noun, use the domain noun from `CONTEXT.md` ("the *Order* aggregate"), not a generic placeholder ("the order service").

## Output contract

Structured conversation. No primary file written. Side-effects:

- `CONTEXT.md` updates land via `/ad-domain` when the proposal surfaces new domain terms.
- ADR drafts land via `/ad-adr` when the three-criteria test passes.
- Implementation lands via `/ad-tdg` after the proposal stabilizes — that skill produces the verified code change.

Each session produces:

1. A numbered list of candidates (Step 2), capped at five.
2. A picked candidate with the grilling loop transcript (Step 3).
3. Routing to `/ad-tdg` with the ground-truth pair seeded from the proposal.

## Next

- After candidates surface but before picking: `/ad-audit` for a broader drift check; the audit may reorder priorities.
- After picking and grilling stabilizes: `/ad-tdg` to implement under WORKFLOW §9 discipline.
- If the proposal touches load-bearing architecture: `/ad-adr` to record the decision (only when the three-criteria test passes).
- If the deepening exposed a domain-vocabulary drift: `/ad-domain` to update `CONTEXT.md`.
- If the candidates all turned out to be bug-symptoms rather than shape-symptoms: `/ad-diagnose` (WORKFLOW §15).
