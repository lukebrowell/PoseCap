# /ad-merge

Implements ADR-0025. Evaluates a PR's mergeability and performs the merge via `gh pr merge`. CI green is the only hard gate; everything else surfaces as a warning the senior engineer decides on.

## Step 0 — Confirm regime

Run when:

- A PR is open against the repo and the user wants to land it.
- The user asks "merge this PR", "evaluate the PR", "is it mergeable".

Route elsewhere when:

- No PR exists yet → `/ad-pr` first.
- Commits are not on the branch yet → `/ad-commit` first.

## Phase 1 — Preflight

Check `gh` is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh --version
gh auth status
```

If absent or not authed, surface the install / `gh auth login` hint and stop (same soft-fail rule as `ad-pr`).

Resolve the target PR:

- If the user passed a PR number / URL, use it.
- Else `gh pr view --json number,headRefName,baseRefName` against the current branch. If that fails (no PR yet for the branch), surface: "No PR found for branch `<name>`. Open one with `/ad-pr` first."

## Phase 2 — Evaluate

Run the structured check and report each line:

```bash
gh pr checks <num>
gh pr view <num> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,reviews,number,title,headRefName,baseRefName
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<num>/comments
```

Findings format (`pass` / `warn` / `fail`):

```
CI status:           <pass | pending | fail>  (gh pr checks)
Fresh-context review: <pass | warn — none found>  (.agentic/reviews/ or gh pr reviews)
Linked task / ADR:   <pass | warn — none>  (commit messages + PR body scan)
Unresolved comments: <pass | warn — N unresolved>
Mergeability:        <pass | dirty | blocked | behind>  (gh pr view mergeStateStatus)
```

Fresh-context review check — scan for either:

- A file under `.agentic/reviews/*` whose name references the PR's commit range or number.
- A `gh pr view --json reviews` entry with `state: APPROVED` from a reviewer (or `state: COMMENTED` with content).

Linked task / ADR — scan commit message bodies under `<base>..HEAD` and the PR body for `task-NNNN`, `ADR-NNNN`, `spec-NNNN`, `#<issue>`, `Closes`, `Fixes`.

Unresolved comments — count entries from `gh api` that lack a `resolved` flag or carry an in-progress thread state.

## Phase 3 — Decision

Apply the bar:

- **CI failing** → **Hard stop.** Refuse to merge until CI is green, *unless* the user explicitly overrides ("merge anyway"). On override, log a loud warning that this is a deliberate CI-failing merge and the responsibility is the user's. Per ADR-0025 §3, even the hard gate yields to explicit user authorization, but the override is surfaced visibly.
- **CI pending** → Ask the user: wait for CI, or proceed anyway? Default = wait.
- **CI green + warnings** (no fresh-context review / no linked task / unresolved comments) → Surface each warning, ask the user to confirm the merge, proceed on confirm.
- **All green** → Proceed.

State the decision back to the user before Phase 4 so they can interject.

## Phase 4 — Merge

Detect repo's allowed merge modes:

```bash
gh repo view --json mergeCommitAllowed,squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed
```

Decision tree:

- **Exactly one mode allowed** → use it.
- **Multiple modes allowed** → ask the user: "Repo allows squash / rebase / merge-commit. Pick one." Wait for their choice.
- **None allowed** (rare) → surface the policy error and stop.

Run the merge:

```bash
gh pr merge <num> --squash    # or --rebase / --merge
gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch
```

`--delete-branch` by default for feature branches (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`, `refactor/*`). Skip `--delete-branch` if the source branch is a long-lived integration branch (e.g., `cli`, `develop`, `release/*`).

Capture and report the merge commit URL.

## Output contract

The output is a merged PR. The skill returns:

- The merge commit URL.
- A one-line summary of what was merged (`<count> commits merged into <base> via <mode>`).
- The list of warnings the user proceeded past (if any), for the audit trail.

## Next

- After merge: pull the latest base locally (`git checkout <base> && git pull`).
- If the merge surfaced a recurring drift (no fresh-context review on multiple PRs, no linked task on several merges): `/ad-audit` to scan for systemic gaps, or update `WORKFLOW.md` §10 / §11 expectations.
- If the merge closed a task: confirm the task file's `Status:` is `done` and the Notes log captures the merge commit URL.
- If the merge shipped a binding decision worth recording: `/ad-adr` (three-criteria rule' ' — hard to reverse, surprising without context, real trade-off).
